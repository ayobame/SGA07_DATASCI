#Question 2 ##What is the difference between R and Python?
  ### I will give the difference in 5 parameters:
  1.Objective
  2.Primary User
  3. Learning curve
  4. IDE
  5. Disadvantages

  Objective
  R: Data analysis and statistics
  Python: Deployment and production

  Primary User
  R: Scholar and R&D
  Python: Programmers and developers

  Learning curve
  R: Difficult at the beginning
  Python: Linear and smooth

  IDE
  R: Rstudio
  Python: Spyder, Ipthon Notebook

  Disadvantages
  R: Slow High Learning curve Dependencies between library
  Python: Not as many libraries as R

#Question 3 ##What is the difference between Functional and Event-based programming

###Functional programming: Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions avoiding state and mutable data
    Main: Lambda calculus, compositionality, formula, recursion, referential transparency, no side effects
    Related Paradigm: Declarative
    Examples:  Kotlin, Lisp, Python, R, Ruby, Scala, SequenceL, Standard ML, JavaScript, Elm, Wolfram Language

Event-based programming: Control flow is determined mainly by events, such as mouse clicks or interrupts including timer
    Main: Main loop, event handlers, asynchronous processes
    Related Paradigm: Procedural, dataflow
    Examples: JavaScript, ActionScript, Visual Basic, Elm

#Question 4 ##What do you understand to be ethical hacking
Ethical hacking and ethical hacker are terms used to describe hacking performed by a company or individual to help identify
potential threats on a computer or network.
An ethical hacker attempts to bypass system security and search for any weak points that could be exploited by malicious hackers.
This information is then used by the organization to improve the system security, to minimize or eliminate any potential attacks
